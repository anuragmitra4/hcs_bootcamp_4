Modified 'Better Snakes' to make it even better

In this project, I added the timer and the score tracking functionaltiy. The game also is able to track the high score.
Apart from that, the two modifications I made to the game are as follows:
- The speed of the snake itself increases each second
- The color of the food is different each time so that the snake is never bored of eating the same fruit over and over again!
